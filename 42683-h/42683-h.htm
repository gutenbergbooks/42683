<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The New Theology is a gathering up of the fragments, antagonizing none
of the Old Theologies, while harmonizing the essential parts of all,
by omitting excrescences and supplying deficiencies. All others have
failed because they are fragmentary and narrow. They do not recognize
the Female principle of Being and its true relation to the Male. They
do not recognize the results of endless Progression, or the outcome of
an infinite and eternal sexual union of the primal principles Love and
Wisdom, which generates the motive power of Being and causes evolution
and all the innumerable manifestations of progressive existence. They
do not explain the origin of the idea of a personal God, nor of the
doctrine of emanation from Him, or the God-Pair. They do not explain
whence the idea of a non-personal Being, pervading everything. None
of them catch a glimpse of the conjugal pair unfolding and rising to
Godhood, when their sphere becomes the parent of universes, by natural
development, thus completing another of the cycles of Being, as we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
in two infants growing into the adult estate and becoming the parents
of other infants. In place of the rule of Law and Order, rising into
the rule of Equity and Love, they substitute the arbitrary rule of a
monarch, full of partiality, favoritism and vindictiveness. The time
has come for something more humane, consistent and rational, more
progressive, comprehensive and complete. This the New Theology supplies
to the advanced mind. Mankind are sloughing off the Old Theologies, and
coming up higher. We are at the turn of the tide, and the New Theology
is a safe craft on which to ride the spiritual waves, in the light of a
new and better era, to a higher condition.</p>

</div>
<h3>4.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Female and Male all things at last appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus Sex thro'out all Nature's realms controls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lowest upward to the highest sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far as mortal eye beholdeth here,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through Sex conjunction everything unfolds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As positive and negative, when met<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In union chemical, the union holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True to proportions which the law hath set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For simples, and they thus new elements beget.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>5.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Together these two forces act as one;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without the one, the other were as nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are the Heat and Light thrown from the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which warm and vivify the earth as run<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The planets in their courses; nor is ought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the face of earth they did not bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through these life-giving rays to us are brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All earthly blessings&mdash;Life and every thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blooms and fructifies to which we fondly cling.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>6.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our sun, like every other sun we see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is a reflex of its Great Prototype,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit Sun, from which perpetually<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is drawn all that is possible to be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That is, all primal principles, when ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the conditions for them to descend<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Into this outer sphere, where Pan's rude pipe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks forth in music, as the forces tend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To consummate through Nature Being's aim and end.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>7.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The home of God, as it to me appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is the Great Spirit Sun, whence emanate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things beheld by scientists and seers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The births of countless myriads of years<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wherein the sexual forces procreate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The suns and universes, and the forms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That naturally fill each vast estate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preparing, through each sun that lights and warms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abodes for future life's innumerable swarms.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>8.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God is a highly conjugated Pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once lowly born and dwelling on some earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far remote that no one may declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or comprehend the stretch of time, or dare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To picture them at the domestic hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where first they felt the flame of love divine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To which their dawning future gave the birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through their consciousness began to shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vast unfolding, as their lives should intertwine.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>9.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They too sprang from a God who had before<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Been born as they, and like to them did grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Mutual Pair, unfolding Being's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For earthly suns and planets to outpour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then become with light and life aglow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As closer still their sexual union grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Life and intelligence unfolded more,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Until the Pair we call our God, with due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And orderly succession, sprang to earthly view.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>10.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They lived and died, as men and women now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are seen to live and die, in earthly sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They entered spirit life, and then the vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love renewed was made, and on each brow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blazing star of faith shone most intense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose to higher spheres, and all aglow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They moved in Love's own aura, issuing hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forming round them in a glorious bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until a sun began its radiance to throw.<br /></span>
</div>
<h3>11.</h3>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The elements of Being evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joined in a closer union, as they must;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they recede, they form a darksome shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like what remained when earthly life was o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the God-Pair behind them left their dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this outer sphere, surrounding all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The only sphere where burneth selfish lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inner heat of Life began to fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suns to burn and throw off earthly ball on ball.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The heights sublime whence he now smiling nods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day we all shall reach, though great the odds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now stretching out from hence to that bright shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For time and space are nothing; the same laws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That governed him, unfolding evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those sprang from him, still working without pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must lift us to his plane, as end doth follow cause.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Meantime, he will go on as we come up,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For we must drink from out the self-same cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the self-same table we must sup;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he, gone on beyond to higher bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be our leader still, above all strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We from his realm, as now we do in this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like branches of the tree with sap grown rife,<br /></span>
